<h2>2025 Event Notes</h2>
<ul style="padding-left:30px;">
<li>When we arrived we paid a gold coin, we recieved a Song book and informed where our group was seated</li>
<li>Only seats were provided, arranged around a center stage of 5 people</li>
<li>We played around 15 songs from the book (one after another) before some of the groups played an item, either seated or standing (smaller groups could come to the front)</li>
<li>We played a few more songs before breaking for afternoon tea</li>
<li>After break we had more groups play an item then special guests play</li>
<li>We then finished the song book off before heading out</li>
<br>
<li>Dont forget your <a href="https://www.mightyape.co.nz/mn/buy/grabstore-sheet-music-stand-47295719932156"><i class="fa-solid fa-shopping-cart"></i> Sheet Music Stand</a></li>

<h2>2025 Thank You Email</h2>
Hello ukulele friends,
<br><br>
That was such a wonderful day sharing music together. Loads of talent and passion - everyone sounded amazing!
<br><br>
Thank you for all coming along, participating, performing, helping, leaders of groups who replied to my emails and prepared your group for your item, the performers at the Open mic and the main event. This wouldn’t have been so successful without everyone’s valuable contribution. People were so friendly with loads of smiles - isn’t the ukulele Community great! (and a few guitar, bass & percussionist friends too :)
<br><br>
Next year there will be a similar format, similar time of the year , a NEW SONGBOOK. Already looking forward to next years Midwinter Strum!!! Will let you know once I’ve secured a date. 
<br><br>
A special mention to Richard, Natalie and Melissa who put a lot of time in effort into leading the strum along. 
<br><br>
Happy strumming,<br>
Keep well and happy,<br>
Adele😊<br>
<br>
